1,"I got this phone on Friday evening.

Pros:
Great battery life
Amazing performance
Premium design
Impressive rear and front camera
In display fingerprint scanner is really fast

Cons:
No headphone jack but you'll get a converter
No notification LED
No microSD card slot
"
2,"Camera quality is not upto the mark. I visited one plus store and the store representative checked my phone and compared the camera quality with his demo phone. He noticed a significant difference between the two.
I request Amazon to replace my phone with a new one as it is evident that this phone has some problems."
3," The Battery lasts max of 6 hours.
Major application not working in the upper side of the screen.
 Camera quality is very poor.
 Audio output through earphone is very poor, same earphone works with other phone is excellent.
 While in a call unable to drop down the notification window.
 Video quality is very poor compared to other less price phones.
I have applied for replacement, not going to take any replacement for such a worst product."
4,One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs 38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.
5,I ordered one plus 6t phone today I got delivered wen I opened found that ear phones missing in the boxes plz let me clear the issue
6,Phone is simply superb in all aspects...low light performance of the camera is outstanding...you simply cannot go wrong with this phone
7,Only one side of speakers is working. Right side is not working
8,After replace the handset issue was resolved. Now i unlocked the speed i need.
9,"Got delivered in just 2.5 hours of my order. No bad overservations yet. Fingerprint unlock is also good, if you have face unlock ON then all the time it will unlock with face data before the the fingerprint works."
10,"Two days back I received 6T and had many problems with the mobileThe mobile is getting heated when it's on camera mode or doing nothing., and while using mobile it's getting struck.. I don't think I got an original set, I'm sure it's a duplicate set.
Please for god sake please exchange my mobile with a new one"
11,"Amazing phone, just feels good.
Done the ma+h, price isn't everything.
You get what you pay for. :)

Excellent battery,
Great screen,
Amazing performance,
Smoooth OS,
Great camera,
Surprisingly decent audio,
Cool screen unlock and ridiculously fast face unlock.

The phone is worth every penny spent."
12,"The device is very bad. Camera quality is very poor. Please don't buy it guys go for Apple iPhone XS instead. Apple has a far better Camera.
No Color options in 256gb variant. OnePlus should learn from Apple they have a lot of Color options at the time of launch. OnePlus is not worth the price."
13,"This has by far been the best phone I have ever used hands-on. Flagship Specs, Classy look, Premium Packaging and the Speed you Need!
Appearance - The device looks very much similar to the OnePlus 6T upfront but it has got the speed orange highlights at the back, carbon finish and McLaren Branding at the bottom.
Camera - The night mode really captures amazing pictures and the portrait mode is just amazing. The low light photography could still be improved.
Battery - With average usage with full day data on, it easily lasts upto 2 days. The Warp charging is just amazing, it takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. But you could easily get a day's charge within 20 mins.
Speed - With 10 Gigs of RAM, speed should not be a question. You could open up 5 high specs games and it still wouldn't lag. And its bragging rights for sure!

Overall, I am really satisfied with this device and feels great to be a part of OnePlus Community! Go, get it! Its for those, who are in continuous pursuit for speed!"
14,Camera pics are not having good quality. Pixel is not clear
15,"The in-display fingerprint sensor is very bad. It is slow and many times it takes multiple attempts to scan the finger. This phone is big disappointment. I would not recommend this phone at all. They didn't give headphone jack which is okay as they were giving free bullets V2 for those who pre-booked the phone. But they should atleast have given IP rating as IP gives peace of mind and stereo speaker should have been there instead of dummy holes at bottom. Needless to say that Oneplus phones have good software and this one is no exception. This has good software which is fast and fluid. My point is that don't buy this phone for fingerprint sensor. If you are having other OnePlus phone then you should hold for next OnePlus phone.

16,Issue with the Camera Slow Motion Mode is Not Working in Home Black Shade is Moving from left to right Sound Quality is not that good
17,"Very nice and fantastic phn, the best smart phn till date, awesome camera good battery life"
18,"Battery-Extremely Poor
Camera-Satisfactory
Look-Good
Weight-Good
Sound-Superb
Overall I would have given it half star,deeply through by it's battery.
And even after the replacement,the same problem persists,which means it's a clear cut case of faulty manufacturing.
Please don't buy it,if you really love your hard earned money...."
19,I like its full display and picture quality is good but temperd glass should be given to all customers
20,mobile is very good and fast.but battery is draining like anythg..within two days of usage i found battery consumption is more than my old phone redmi note4
21,"Google Play does not work properly, apps are downloading after 3-4 attempts.. Very Heavy and does not fit well in hands
Very poor quality of preapplied screen guard. Bubbles came only after 30 minutes of usage
Camera is very ordinary"
22,"Used it for close to 45 days now, overall a very good phone but for this price point i would expect much better camera. Since Asus Zenfone 5Z also gives similar performance at almost less than 10K. Camera in night mode needs more improvement and does not capture the picture properly .. may be i need to do some tweeks in settings i am not sure. Please see the image i uploaded the fire is tarnished with grey .. same picture without night mode is much better. This is my first 1+ phone .. satisfied but because of camera giving 4 stars."
23,"Crisp picture quality, impactful sound and an impressive battery life makes it a worthy investment. A blind buy for those who plan to upgrade to OnePlus from others...
Fingerprint sensor, face unlock are exciting features but not indispensible.
All in all its a fair deal if the base variant itself is 128gb!! What more can u ask for!!
I'm happy...
N yes...Thank you Amazon for the On time delivery.."
24,"Bought the costliest one. 8gb 256gb model.
Received a phone with flickering screen, screen shows different colors every now and then... Battery drains fast and phone heats up even on normal usage. I have used OP3t for 2 years and never faced any problem. But This one didnt stay even for 2 days and I had to request for replacement. 1 day passed and no help, finally anazon says replacement not possible, only refund possible. I hope at least the refund process goes smooth.

25,Brightness is very low. I was using OnePlus 5. 20% of brightness in OnePlus 5 is equal to 65% brightness in 6T which may cause in draining the battery. Not happy with it. Also unlocking with fingerprint is not up to the mark. Totally not so happy with it. Thinking to return it and use OnePlus 5 only
26,"First and foremost...I really dont miss those 3.5 mm jack. Using bluetooth earpiece and the sound quality is top notch.

Picture quality - initial shots taken are impressive.
Battery life is best among all one plus phones.

Build quality is superb. No issues with call clarity and now the best part...Oxygen OS. Its buttery smooth, fluidic and unputdownable. You will ne addicted to it.

Only con is the weight of the device."
27,"Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly.

 They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit."
28,"Impressive at this price point. Only disappointment is absence 3.5 mm headphone jack. Had Oneplus supplied bullets headphone as default accessory, it would have been a complete package. Apple, learn from it, else your days are numbered."
29,"I pre-ordered the phone on 9th Oct and literally waited for more than a month for this phone. It was worth waiting.
Phone looks similar to one plus 6 however the technology you get in this phone is updated and is latest. The notch looks beautiful compared to other waterdrop notch phones. I'm not an audiphile so can't complain much about the removal of headphone jack. I'm pretty comfortable with wireless earphones. The OS is something which needs to be considered the most on a phone, which most of the people ignore. I migrated from a Sony phone and see a huge difference in the usage, the OS is smooth as butter and is calibrated for daily driver. You can perform many tasks at a snap of your fingers and never experience a lag on the phone. Camera is good, clicks are clear. Portrait and night mode are very useful and handy. Slow motion works well. Battery life is comparably good, you get around 6 hrs of SOT from a full charge. I feel that's more than enough for a daily driver and works well for gamers. Charging is pretty fast you can charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 20min.

I feel it's worth paying 40k for a premium phone like this, which offers good support for your OS and provides Android updates for 2 yrs. Rather than spending 25k+ for plastic and non premium phones. BTW this comes with no bloatware and is completely based on stock OS which contains a lot of tweaks and customizatios. That's the best part of the phone.
Go for it if you don't want to compromise !!"
30,"Don't buy this Mobile worst network connectivity also no support any service centres, in Maharashtra only 4 services centre unfortunately at my location 300 km from me I was so sad call centre suggest me you visit to service centre to resolve issues .....very slow browsing like 2G phones ...... camera is good but without connecting network it's like only photographer camera..."
31,"Pros: Hardware supports good speed and camera.
Cons: Screen unlock doesn't work most of the time. Fingerprint is not upto mark and takes a few tries. Also Google smart Lock is not working. There was a defect on the screen protector applied and Amazon says that they product will not be replaced and they cannot do anything about it. Oneplus says buy a new tempered glass and put it!! Fingerprint sensor is hardly able to cope with the normal plastic protector. I don't know how will it work with a thick one. This was the first time I had problem with a product from Amazon and they showed their true colors. Sameer goes for OnePlus."
32,Super nice
33,Phone is not working after update.I need immediate replacement or need my money back without further delay.
34,Great for all specs except for the battery life. Battery drains faster than expected. Without that totally worth it…
35,"If yuh are a Iphone user please stay away.,
Yu’ll definetely nt like it"
36,"Picture quality is good. Battery life is decent. Sound quality is okay. It's not a beast in any regards considering it's price and the flagship killer tag. You may miss the notification led and the 3.5 mm audio jack. The in screen fingerprint reader is a cool feature but surely feels that first gen not so smooth feature. It just gives you the feeling of not buying a finished product but a work in progress kind of a thing. Not many things to complaint about since it does give you good specifications for a decent price but.. it's no longer a flagship killer to stay. One plus may very well be the new apple. I'd hate to see that happen, but they're in the business for profit afterall. It can't always all be about the community. But I see them get run over by budget phones if their competition could maintain quality"
37,Everything is good about the phone except some software bugs like gestures dnt work flawlessly and i have issue with paint coming out from the top part of the phone near the ear piece
38,One plus 6 is better than 6t
39,"I just got the new one plus 6t. But not received all other accessories with it. Only received one charger , one protective case that s it. Type C to audio adapter is missing."
40,Very disappointed with slow mo camera quality. I wish I could return the phone.
41,"Worst product i ordered on 1st november 2018 at 00.01 hours i got the product but only ised 1 day and now the phone is not charging and the phone is dead.
Dint expect such a baaaaaaddd product.
I always used one plus but from now onwardd no one plus"
42,I just unlocked the speed today but it disappointed me I can't download apps it takes forever to download for a brand which promotes that it is very fast really disappointed.the battery also drains really fast really disappointed with the phone .I don't recommend this phone at all it also force close few apps after normal use of apps
43,battery drain issue
44,"I got this phone with a minor scratches on the pre installed screen protector, however I'm not sure if those are on the protector or the screen itself. I couldnt file a complain since I am travelling constantly. Will obviously reach out you guys once I'm getting back home."
45,"Please don't buy..gets heated, doesn't start
Customer care has no interest pls don't buy 6t worst one plus product"
46,The whole product is good but 36k is more for it
47,It is not worth for the money. Low light camera performance still low. 25K poco does equal to 6T. In display finger print is laggy. You definitely won't like it. Good battery life.Average display. Performance is good.
48,Build quality is good. Phone is looking handsome. Two things bothering me. one is notification light. There is no notification light on top of screen so I need to awake my phone everytime to check any message or so. Second thing is fingerprint sensor. It is very sensible I must say unlike the back one. I need to put my finger in proper way otherwise I won't be able to unlock my phone.
49,"The phone got stuck while using one of camera features. Its not even getting restarted. The screen is freezed thus, not allowing to proceed further. Hope i get a replacement soon."
50,"Takes too long to charge...took 80minutes to charge from 10%-96%.
Battery life went down from 100%to 10% in less than 20hours without much usage.
Fingerprint sensor not very receptive."
51,I have not received headphones as promised by pre book OnePlus 6t
52," Picture quality zero third class
 Heat while charging
heat issue while playing game like pubg
 Slipry grip
 Heavy weight
 Camera in night also wrost
 When you zoom picture taken by 6t shows the blur images and red eyes
 There lack of A. I artificial intelligence
 Face lock security is totaly unsafe i tried open with my passport size foto & opend screen lock
 Battery life is good fast charging but heating issue also
 No headfone jack you have to manage with charging jack adapter of headfone
I return after using 2 days & thanks to amazone to refund on time and saves my money by return / refund policy"
53,"Speaker is not working, not happy with the product. I have placed request for replacement but haven't received any confirmation from Amazon yet. Very disappointed."
54,"If you are a op5,op5t or op6 user it is not worth upgrading
cons of oneplus 6t:
1 the indisplay fingerprint is way too slow and does not work always
2 the phone still has some network connectivity issues(s/w upgrades may fix them)
3 phone works fast BUT expensive for the price and lacks good features like IR blaster,gloves mode, only limited gestures
4 it seems interesting for a week, later its just a normal budget phone
5 the low light photos in 'nightscape' is still bad,overall camera is just OK(not as hyped )
Pros:
1 Phone feels more premium than Rs.25,000 phones but still does not provide the vibe of apple or samsung(note & S series)
2 has good customer care support (especially online)
3 the software(oxygen OS) is really smooth,no lags at all
for those looking for phones for at least 2-3 years of usage,if possible wait for oneplus 7
hope to see a triple rear camera and 5G on oneplus7"
55,"Coming from OnePlus 2, this is a huge upgrade. So I liked many things about this phone. Amazing display. I'm not a notch fan but this is the cutest notch I've seen. Absence of 3.5mm jack might be a let down for many fans including me and I still don't agree with their decision. There is no LED notifications also.

Performance wise there's no need of even comparing because this is the best (SD845+OxygenOS+8GB RAM = TRUE WONDER).

Didn't get a chance to test the camera much, so no comments on the camera.

Some might face problems with fingerprint scanner but register them properly and you would not get any problems. I had none till now.

I didn't think that the case in the box would be so good. It's very nice and I've seen phone dropping from 10ft not breaking with this case.
Many intrusive ads are comparing this with Pocophone F1. I just laugh at them. OnePlus has a way more premium feel than Pocophone."
56,"Best phone !!!
In love with the fingerprint scanner and it's animation !
Battery lasts one day !
Industry leading camera with studio mode works fantastic !
Catchy display !
Fast like a flash !
Great Value for money !!!!!"
57,"Received faulty piece of mobile, battery can't even last for 6 hours, I am going to return it"
58,"very poor product from one plus and neither amazon is replacing the device battery didn't last long much not even 5 or 6 hours the device is malfunctioning like opening apps on it's own and volume is increasing or decreasing on it's own
not satisfied with the product"
59,"There are two speakers in One Plus 6T, One speaker is not working"
60,"DESIGN:
If you thinking that OnePlus 6 and 6T has no major difference than you are absolutely wrong and highly mistaken if you thing 6 is better than 6T. Price hike is completely justified.

Visible differences between 6 & 6T:
Higher screen to body ratio, Gorilla Glass 6, in-display fingerprint scanner, taller, water-drop notch. 3700mAh battery.

Technical advancement:
Advance AI which smartly uses your RAM and ROM which actually boosts the performance, Better heat-sink than 6.

CAMERA:
I took my canon 1300D with two lens; portrait and 18-55 and OnePlus6T for comparison test. OnePlus 6T provided better results when both on Auto-mode. It has amazing contrast, perfect saturation; but the thing where it stood-out from others its it night picture quality. It does wonders even if there is almost no light and that is some magic over there. Front camera absolutely stunning and comes with screen flash for low light selfies.
BATTERY:
Battery charging- 0 to 65% in 30 mins and at 45 min it reaches 86%. Full charge by 1hr8 mins when internet, Bluetooth and wifi off. On heavy use it survives 8 hrs (I watched 2 movies in HD with 50% screen brightness and 1 hour PubG gaming on HD, 1 hour YouTubing). On average usage, 17 hours very smoothly(casual social media surfing, browsing, camera usage about 5 to 6 pictures using flash). Without internet usage at all and battery saver on, it can go whooping 3 DAYS !

SPEAKERS:
External speakers are loud, I mean really very loud. Hearing speaker is very cool by its looks and loud too. Volume rockers and power switch is perfectly hard.

SECURITY:
Though I feel face detection is worst type of security because it has many drawbacks, its quick. And finger print scanner is also faster than its competitors. The part which irritates is that while using at night in dark, for face and fingerprint detection, the display gets 100% to scan which is very annoying and very uneasy for eyes."
61,"I am a big fan of Apple. Have been using Iphone from last 5 years. Wanted to change the phone to the new one. But not much of Innovation from Apple. So, I switched to Oneplus and Oneplus 6T was a best replacement.
The OnePlus 6T brings new technology and worthwhile improvements to the table making this the best phone from OnePlus yet.
Design: Just gorgeous - the curve of the camera bump is more of a design accent than a notch. The phone has a huge 6.41 in screen, but is still easily managed with one hand. The color is amazing - Mirror Black. The 6T feels like it was meant to fit in my hand. The first party OnePlus cases accent the amazing design and make it even more comfortable. When you hold the phone, you will know exactly what I mean!

Battery: Lasts more than a day with heavy use. I can get almost 6 hrs of screen on time even after watching YouTube, gaming, and general usage. Even better, the included dash charger fills the battery extremely quickly. No wireless charging, but I don't even miss it.

Camera: Solid - 4K 60FPS video looks great. Other phones in this price range can't even touch the quality of the camera for pictures. Night shot is solid, looking forward to Future tweeks to prevent the blown out appearance when some light is present.

Sound: Probably the only change I would make. The since downward firing speaker is easy to block. The quality is great - would love to see the dual speaker in the next OnePlus phone.

While you could say that OnePlus has made some sacrifices in developing the OnePlus 6T, they all seem rather subjective. Sure it’s a slightly bigger, thicker, heavier phone than the 6 but if that means a bigger battery with better longevity is it really a loss?
The headphone jack’s absence is annoying for some but the phone comes with an adapter and the in-display fingerprint sensor might not have fit in the same footprint otherwise."
62,Super
63,Damaged
64,"Phone functions are nice. Battery performance is not lasting good. Battery is dying very rapidly. I am changing full charge twice in 24hrs still battery is getting down to 19%. Most funny part is that I am hardly using my phone. This is very depressing after paying such a big amount (hard earned money) of Rs. 38000/- and battery performance is so much poor.
Spoken to the Amazon technical support for this. They have done some online test through some app and get to know that something is wrong with this phone battery and told me for the ""BRAND NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE"" on Monday 5th November 2018. I have received my phone on 2nd Nov and spoken to Amazon technical support engineer on 3rd Nov. Although I haven't received any email / SMS from Amazon yet. I can trust them on there words and will receive brand NEW REPLACEMENT PHONE on 5th November itself."
65,I purchased one plus 6t on nov 1st and gor it delivered on nov 3rd. Everything is fine but touch is not functioning properly at the corners of diaplay. Didn't expect such issue with onw plus
66,"Hello Guys,
I am using this phone past 2 days over all phone is good its worth to buy. But there are some issues which i am mentioning below.
1- battery is not so good, its draning fast not so fast but ya fast.
2- there is no am -pm in clock which very basic function in every damn phone.
3- you can face internet problem may be your sim doesn't support the handset. But there is issue.
4- performance what i was expecting is not top notch what company claiming. You can get same kind of speed in 20k phone easily.
5- lastly the finger scanning lock is not so fast, sometimes it takes 2-3 attempts.
Guys this is my geniune report about this phone. I m very much fan of oneplus family. But 2 times i took wrong decisions 1- for oneplus 5 it was a worst phone and
2- OnePlus 6t actually its not a worst phone but i was expecting a top notch speed. But OnePlus 6t not match that level.
If you have budget to buy and you want it anyhow than you can go for it.... Otherwise there are lots of better options. Available in market in 20k which match almost same quality & look. So don't waste your money if you don't have much in your pocket. Don't push your self to buy this phone.
I am give this phone 3 star just bcz its not that bad but its not that good. Now choices upto you."
67,Best pH ever..👍👍👌👌
68,"Adding another call, when a call is already in progress is night mare. Either app crashes or it doesnt allow. During phone call disabling blue tooth is not posisble. I see lot of UI issues. God only why people were so hyped about this phone. its not doing what 7000rs Samsung phone does. Please don't buy this phone and waste your money."
69,I got a defective product
70,"Things are not the same as promoted, I bought this on 2nd Nov, look wise its good, sound is also loud, its just loud nothin else, battery has just improved marginally if you keep your location on and play some game or video, it will be low very soon. Ofcourse at the end it will hang little longer but not as expected. Display Hangs!! Yes!!! this phone hangs even with 8gb RAM, have faced it few times even in first 10 days. Worst part is the front screen lock is too too slow, even i have to use pin code most of the time. Overall the phone launch was just a hype but the performance is not upto the expectation!!!"
71,38000 price not good
72,very bad
73,"I am using oneplus 6t phone from 1st of November and I am facing issue with camera when I m using camera with flash then image taking blur and in yellow colour this issue I am facing after updating oneplus 6t phone
"
74,Add/ enable proper always on display.. without LED notification light we can't see notification.. really not satisfied disabled always on display/Ambiant display…
75,As the slogan says never settle....proper flagship killer
76,"Battery life is better. Picture quality is good. Sound quality is also reasonably good but definitely not the best among its competitors. Having said that, this phone is really really fast. Display is awesome. Dash charger is wow as usual."
77,I like this product very much
78,"Purchased with great excitement but disappointed the day i got this phone.. Being a flagship killer, i never expected this phone to face heat issues even with a normal usage..the same problem didn't arise with my brother's phone which he took on the same day... Apps didn't download but some how solved that issue later.. And now some apps are force closing and not working.. Remaining features live upto the mark. But being a oneplus fan, my expectations were sky-high about the 6t..slightly disappointed but not a big deal.. Can adjust with this."
79,picture quality is worst
80,Worst service from amazon.never expected this.lost believe in this.they delivered defective piece and not providing the replacement for this.Horrible ecperience
81,"No headphone jack! Just bigger battery and water drop notch. No camera improvement, below expectations.... Don't buy this phone just wait for oneplus7 ( hope some exiting features)... If you have oneplus 6 then don't buy it because no major ( even minor) improvement in it ( 6 is better than 6t) and if you are not a oneplus user then also don't buy it. I was so excited about this phone but disappointed."
82,Never buy this phone worst experience ever hopless phone
83,"For the cost , this is one value for money product. It is feature rich and perfect for a person like me. Am an avid foodie and traveller. This is a perfect phone to capture what I want whenever I want . And with amazing clarity. Also amazing speed . I became a fan with OnePlus 3 and this one has be convinced that this is one of the best smart phone options out there."
84,"pros:-1.gorilla glass 6
2.battery3700mah,

13.no overheating issue,
cons:-1.battery drains fast,
2.no 3.5mm jack,
3.no stereo speaker
4.portrait mode photos are always not so good."
85,"The OnePlus 6T is undeniably the most advanced and accomplished phone from the company till now. The OnePlus 6 is still good, but the 6T gives it a boost in the battery department and a fancy way to unlock at a perfect price.
Cons :
Concern is the notification led light. we are not sure whether battery is 100% while charging. Single touch display to see notification is beautiful.
One plus should have added the charge + 3.5 jack in type c converter. which would be added value for those who watch movie or listen song while charging."
86,"Battery is terribly bad.
On round edges I lose the display as it cuts the actual view.
Sometimes AutoRotate does not work. I have to restart the mobile."
87,The discount could have been more
88,"I have purchased this phone and trusted amazon for over 2 years but now i am feeling stunned with the product quality.This phone gets switch off sometimes and getting ON only by hard rebooting but when i tried to return it , first a 3rd party app told me that your phone is all right. So if this kind of service is provided by amazon then i am not gonna do any kind of purchase from amazon.This is very bad.Worst service by amazon"
89,"Airtel Sim not working on new oneplus6t, Pathetic.
However other carriers are working"
90,I did prebook but I don't get bullet earphones
91,Not worth of price
92,"I have used two days and phone is good with speed and multi tasking but camera is worst, it did not meet even a normal 10000 rupees phone camera feature. I am planning to sell it out in OLX. Oneplus should stop increasing the phone size, since phone is slippery in the hand with 6.41 inches, always 6 or less than 6 inches phones are good to carry and handy."
93,Best phone i ever had
94,"I am experiencing very difficulty in receiving calls and I'm conversation with my callers THROUGH AIRTEL since it is being used for official purpose. In the 2nd slot BSNL sim. Although it is working but sometimes it also giving similar problem. Sound quality is poor, using full volume is require to hear the caller voice. I tried my best to exchange the device within the return period but failed as I experienced very difficulty in replacing the product with AMAZON THIS TIME.
MY PRESENT STATUS IS THAT SOME HOW I HAVE TO DISPOSED IT.
I FIND MORE BETTER WITH MY REDMI NOTE 5 PRO.
I am just waiting for 15-20 days as ONE PLUS CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTRE INFOM ME THAT IT WILL BE QUITE ALRIGHT AFTER AN UPGRADATION WICH IS ABOT TO COME WITHIN THE ABOVE TIME.
However, I can only say that being a prime member I maintained a higher expectations but disappointed. SORRY."
95,Hanging problem selfi camera not good
96,"Made a huge mistake in buying this phone.
Apple is far far far far far and far and again far better.
Best part amazon didn't accept for return"
97,good
98,"Annoyed by Amazon,i got a defective OnePlus 6t and Amazon is replacing it, and giving me excuse about seller.

99,"Pictures taken in daylight are decent. However, pictures taken during night are really really bad and the night mode doesn't give you the sort of pictures you would expect from an top end phone. Sound clarity over the calls is pretty bad. Battery life is decent at best. Now, coming to the in display fingerprint sensor it doesn't work all the time. It's way too slow and doesn't respond most of the time."
100,Lovely mobile... Simply love it.
101,Awesome phone midnight black is looks more beautiful
102,"I have been using this device for over a week now and so far it has turned out to be a beast of a device. Here are my observations:
1. The in-display screen unlocker: It is flawed. Takes a bit of a time to unlock and you have to place the finger properly. But this was not that big of a deal, since the face unlocking is supremely fast. Its a novelty kind of thing. looks nice when it works. 4/5 for this
2. Camera: my previous device was OP 5t. The picture quality has increased manifold. Nightscape, studio lighting and ultra slo-mo video works like a charm. 5/5 for this
3. Battery life: the first day, the device got slightly heated when i used oneplus switch so the battery drained quickly. But over the week, it has given me wonderful battery backup. No heating issue. With average to heavier usage, it still gave me 1.5 days backup. The charging is very fast. 40 minutes to charge from 10 to 95%. More than sufficient. 4.75/5 for this
4. Speaker: Only one speaker is present, but it gives out very loud output. Gives very good clarity and loud ringing. No complaints or issues regarding this. 5/5
5. OS: It is the cleanest and simplest OS yet. Lots and lots of customization, minimum bloatware. clean interface. in OP5T, the messaging app did not differentiate between marketing related messages and actual messages. fortunately, this phone has that capability. Loved the gestures as well. Optimizations are also great new feature. 5/5
6. Build: All one plus devices are wonderfully built and 6T is no exception. Even though the glass back is there, I didnt find any slippage. Of course I am using the back cover which is already provided with the phone now. But I think it has much better grip than the other phones. 5/5

Bottom line is that this is a device which you would want to own for a long time. Most of the budget phones start developing problems within 1 year of manufacturing, but that has not been my experience with One plus devices. Even after more than 1 year of using OP 5T, I still got the same performance I was getting during my first month with it. 6T is slightly costly but completely worth it in my opinion."
103,just superb
104,"Bad camera quality
I'm not satisfied with product take return"
105,"I waited for a long time for the Oneplus 6T model launch. I purchased it with lots of expectations and I am happy that it met my most of the expectations. I purchased Oneplus 6T 128gb and 6gb RAM version mirror black phone.

Pros :-

1) Super fast processor- can play large games without any glitch.

2) Camera is super amazing. However in the night mode, the pictures are sometimes hazy. Overall it is good.

3) The phone is damn beautiful. The back of the phone is simply outstanding. Notch also looks cute.

4) Fingerprint sensor is working fine.

5) Sound quality is good. The speakers are loud and bass is also good. However, the company should have launched it with dual speakers. It would have been phenomenal.

6) The company has increased the battery size. It gives a backup of atleast 1.5 days with normal usage.

Cons:-
1) NO HEADPHONE JACK. The company was making fun of Apple for removing the headphone jack, but they did the same. I just have a doubt that how will I charge my phone and watch a movie via earphones at the same time. I have to buy an external adapter which will put a dent on my pocket again.

2) If I am holding my phone and have put my thumb impression as my Fingerprint phone unlock option. Then sometimes it is difficult to unlock the phone. Coz while holding the phone I have to put my thumb straight which is quite difficult.

3) The night mode of the camera needs improvement.

4) No dual speaker.

Conclusion:

It is a nice phone with brilliant specifications. It easily beats some of the high end phones of Apple , Samsung and LG and others. So you may go for it."
106,"Here is my review of op6 McLaren Edn after 4 days of uses.
Camera is excellent, takes outstanding pictures. Sound quality is ok but not at par. Oneplus could have done better.
Battery life is phenomenal. Lasts for almost 30 hours with 10 hours of screen on time. Running 4g all the time.

The one and only con that I observed is internet speed is very slow . I saw someone's review before buying this phone that network strength is very good compared to other phones and indeed it is. But inspite of having good signals, the 4g internet speed is very slow. And I mean very slow like 2g. McLaren doesn't stand up to its name. Did all the tricks, read all the forums about the solution but nothing worked. Same sim is giving excellent speed in another phone.
I feel like cheated. Whats the point keeping superfast phone if you cannot have a fast internet.
Won't recommend anyone to buy this phone."
107,"I have bought OnePlus6T, its not a true value for money.

As per the price my ratings are as follows:
Music Quality 2/5.
Picture Quality 4/5 as compared to other mobile and 3/5 as compared to point and shoot cameras.
Sound Quality - 4.5/5
Settings and other user friendly features - 3/5 Samsung is better than this.
Availability of accessories 2/5, the accessories are costly and not easily available as well.
Bugs are also there, which company is not able to fix till now."
108,Phone is awesome camera check display check battery check... There is minor glitch with play store it is pathetic to download a new app as they always shows downloading or download pending.... Hope OnePlus will fix this…
109,"Overall amazing product for the price point .. but now its on the edge. One plus has been slowly increasing prices year on year and now they are in INR40K range. Further one or more price hikes and people will start going back to Flagship companies. Lets hope they keep it as Value for money.

Regarding phone:
Superb edge to edge display & battery life - No complaints here. 1080P screen is crisp enough and gives good battery life. Notch is actually just tiny camera and bottom chin has become further thinner.
Software: Oxygen OS - as usual its clean and gives stock experience with few customizations. Since phone has been just launched have experienced few bugs, but lets hope one plus gives quick updates to solve these.
Build Quality/looks: Thumbs Up! to OnePlus. Glass black and body design does give premium feel. But somehow felt phone is on heavier side (I have switched from OnePlus5 to OnePlus6T and definitely there's noticeable difference in weight).
Fingerprint scanner: Works well most of the times but not as fast as physical fingerprint scanners we have been used to of earlier phones. If screen gets smudgy you will have problem of unlocking device as it requires clean surface to work.
Only cons, I have experienced in this phone are No headphone jack and LED notification light. Most useful part of LED light was of charging notification. Now you have to wake screen and check. For headphones you do get C-Type connector but as it sounds ""No 3.5mm headphone Jack"" - nothing to describe here.

But overall its a good package and still its a Value for money! You can go for it for sure."
110,"Brought it on 3rd Nov. Attached is the list of issue
- GPS turn on automatically
- Bluetooth turn on Automatically
- Chrome hangs very now and then
- Screen Cast does not work / takes ages to connect
- InScreen fingerprint scanner is worst

Online support could not solve the problem , and ask to visit service center
Being the premium brand they have only 3 service center (???) in city like bangalore . One visit to MG Road will cost me whole day of my time. Just thinking again was it a good choice at all ???"
111,"Picture quality is not up to the mark, it's not as per the description given. Need to work hard on the same. Pic gets blurred when we zoom the camera. It states 20mp camera, but I don't think so that actually is."
112,"Best Android phone till date. I have been using it for 3 days now and OnePlus didn't let me down.
* Great battery life. I use mobile for texting, taking pics and pubg usually. I charge it once a day which is pretty great.
* Dash charging does help the phone to get charged to 90% in 50-60mins (3700mAh).
* You all know about the specs abt camera. But one thing to note is unlike oneplus 6, 6t's pro mode has bigger capture size.
* On screen finger print scanner amazes me each time I use it. Animation is so great. One thing i'd like to mention abt this animation is it is too bright even when brightness of the screen is minimum which is bad when you want to unlock ur phone at night time.

This is the best phone you can buy in 2018 and early 2019 at around 35-40k. So go ahead and buy it, I'm sure you won't regret it!"
113,Phone is good and phone sound was very good but battery is very bad I am not satisfied this phone
114,The alert slider is not working. Did not expect a defected piece from amazon. very disappointing. for replacement a technicuan from amazon will come and report. before that im left wid no phone. its so disheartening.
115,"AS I HAD ALREADY CUSTOMER OF ONE PLUS 5,IAM VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH PACKING MATERIAL OF ONE PLUS 6T, I COMPARE BOTH BOXES OF ONE PLUS 5 AND 6T
WHEN I PICK MY NEW PHONE 6T,I FOUND MATERIAL USED IS VERY DULL,MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS 0
BUT OVERALL PHONE IS WORKING WELL WITH LESS BATTERY BACKUP"
116,"1. If you will see IPHONE then each application's UI will be the semetrical and properly handled, Unlike the oneplus 6T
if you will notice then while you are in CHAT then Bottom SEND and left SMILY button will not show 100% properly.
2. Without using any app it consumes 4+GB of RAM.
3. Camera quality is OK+ , Because its using almost same library of PIXEL phone, But not match that image processing quality. FRONT CAMERA QUALITY is just WROST ever if you will try on Artificial Light condition.
4. If you ZOOM once you took the picture it will not show the Best quality resolution.
4. If your phone will be in IDEAL mode for 10+ mins then your phone will be freeze for 7-8 Seconds."
117,"The phone is excellent software and internals wise. However the cons are as follows:

- all glass. Serves no purpose and makes the phone fragile
- no notification light
- no headphone jack. Pointless omission simply to ape Apple
- ambient display brightens up too much for sensing fingerprint and is very irritating at night
- phone is a tad too big. They should ideally have kept the 5.5 screen size from the op5 days and removed the bezels instead of increasing the size of the phone
- terrible vibration motor. My old nokias from the last decade had much better vibration. Not expected from such a premium phone"
118,My new one plus 6t is stucking a lot. Screen getting blank every time it get stucked. It stucked 5 times in last two days. Requesting you to please replace my phone.
119,"This is my first OnePlus Device and it feels amazing that how fast this phone is! I switched from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and I'm glad I did....Battery life is just outstanding and I've never ever got such a powerful battery ever in my smartphone life. It actually lasts more than a day with lots of playing (I'm a Gamer) and general usage. Camera is also very good and certainly better than my previous phone. UI is clean and lightning fast. Build quality and finish is premium, sturdy and not at all fragile. The in-box Type-C to 3.5mm Adapter solves the absence of headphone jack problem. The supplied case is of premium quality and easily gives all-round protection to any angle falls. Dash charging is superb too. Android Pie out-of-the-box is cool but restricts call recording from third party apps (which is must for me), but OP did a fantastic job of putting in-built call recorder which works flawlessly in Pie as well. As of now, I don't see a single negative point for this phone. Its truly a remarkable one! Thank You OnePlus and Amazon!"
120,"Camera is pathetic. Takes blurry pics sometimes. Pics gets detoriarated on little bit of zooming also. Looks like its a 8mp camera. Samsung takes better pics even in 8k phone. Low light is equally bad. Poor selfie camera. Those saying awesome camera have no idea about cameras. Improve camera performance in the next update.

Its blazzing fast. Smooth. Looks great. But cam and speakers r disappointment."
121,"They are exactly Working on their tag line ""the speed you need"". It's very fast. Very very fast. Talking about camera, that would have been better than op6. But nothing changed. Night scape is very good change. You can feel the light in nightscape mode. Audio is better than most of smartphones but not up to One plus mark. Battery life is best. You can rely on his battery for only one charge of half an hour with full day battery life even if you use it fully. Fingerprint scanner can't be better. New update help him open fast. If you have budget of 35k, buy it without second thought."
122,"The phone overall is supposed to be flagship killer. But the truth is that despite killing flagship it can’t kill the performance and stability of the previous model one plus 6. As someone who has both the phones in the family my observation is in comparison with one plus 6 and I feel one plus has gone down on the standards with the new phone.
Pros
Better sound than 6
Photos have better depth and clarity
Battery back up is good
Cons
Fingerprint unlock is absolutely lacking performance and does not work at times
Phone hangs at times and does not feel like it’s a one plus product or having 6 gb ram
Camera freezes and sometime renders all buttons including power button action less

Hope OnePlus comes with a sw update to handle all the issues, else this is gonna bring bad press for them."
123,"Mobile is too good , but product i received faulty , on 2 nd day I connected to charging by keeping g switch off and change sim card . it cant switched on . I placed immediately replacement order and Amazon take it properly. Thanks Amazon. But now I cancelled and all order."
124,"The product was defective. And amazon kept me on wait for 10 days for no reason to replace the phone,even it was manufacturing defects."
125,"This was for my sister. She previously had iphone 8 and believe me she loved the oneplus.
I am myself using a oneplus 6 and while comparing it with the T version.

There are only slight differences apartment from the notch size battery capacity and on screen fingerprint reader.

I particularly doesn't feel for the need for a quad HD screen since the screen quality is amazing.

They could have added bwtter camera modules and instead of the depth sensor , they could have put a telescopic lens

Speaker quality has improved from the 6 but they should have added stereo speakers.

I know some are xomolaing about the jack but sooner or later everyone will start using Bluetooth headphones, just like touch screen phone made a revolution.

The biggest upgrade that i personally feel is the 400mah increase in battery capacity.

I never had any issues with the 6 but the 6t wouod easily last 2 days for a moderate user"
126,"Firstly i would like to thank oneplus for making a device like that. The best part of the phone is the performance which you expect from a snapdragon 845 chip .. obviously you are paying for that.
(Or han"" don't do the math"" i have poco f1 too,, 6t is better in everything. worth paying more.. )

*Now the Issues are..
1. Lack of 3.5mm jack which can be a deal breaker for many people. But honestly not for me. Because i don't have a wired earphone or headphone. It's 2k18 even my car doesn't have an aux port. (Android auto). If still u want to use then there is a connector comes with the box.
2 . Notification led.
If they provided a led on the top of display then you have to compromise with that beautiful notch.
Again not a deal breaker.

*Important*
I have seen many people are saying in reviews. That they have not received cash back or type c bullet earphones with box. Not sure about. The cash back. But. If you pre book this device. It is mentioned that u will receive a code to purchase those earphones by 15 nov. U will not get those with the box..
And about the cash back i had purchased it at rs 46k(8ram 256rom) nd i received that 1000 instantly nd 500 on 5th nov.

Chaliye ab kuch buraiya bhi karde

*Sound quality can be better..
*Not ip certified. It is just splash proof (but i don't know how to swim so I'm not taking my phone in pool... again not a deal breaker)
Buss ab kharid lia or burai nhi hoti."
127,"Hello Guys, it’s been 1 week since I got (8GB/256GB) one of the best phone in market. As expected OnePlus deliver customs expectations.
Regarding phone it’s of course best in the market, battery charging takes around 75 minutes from 5% to 100%. Discharging is pretty normal compared to its competitors. Photo clarity is good enough in normal/ portrait mode but night mode I don’t feel good enough, it takes longer time to stabilise and we need to hold and wait. Video and photo clarity is good but not the best in market or less comparatively than my Lumia 950XL. Fingerprint sensor is not much sensitive and takes .5 to 1 sec to open, had a angle problem which resolved in recent update but still lag remains same. Face recognition is perfect. I feel phone is in top 5 for gaming with separate gaming mode, don’t see any lag in WCC 2/ Asphalt/ PUBG. Screen size, display is pretty good and as expected. Sound quality is same as it’s lower end models no much difference. Overall I am happy with other specifics except night mode, fingerprint sensor."
128,Had audio issues . Asked for replacement
129,"I am writing this review ,after usage of 15 days.

Phone is fabulous, build quality is also excellent.
Sound quality:
If you often listen music loudly then you may not like it, as it does not have dual speaker, so either buy a good JBL or Bose speakers or look for another phone.

Battery Life: Its Dash charge bro, my 6t got fully charged in 1:28 hours from 0to99.
Typical usage, may lead one or one and half day battery.(Typical means listening song, often watching YouTube or online movie etc.)
It gets slightly warm while charging , later I found that it's normal .
Software :It has oxygen is , except pixel of Google . One plus is the only brand in android to provide updates time to time. Software is also very smooth to use.

Hardware:Snapdragon 845 very fast,
Con:no qhd display,no led notification light.
Pros: On screen fingerprint ,very fast as compared to any other on screen fingerprint, but slightly slower than typical fingerprint.(Its 0.3sec., typical opens in0.15 to0.20sec)
I also noticed that of you kept your phone inactive for half an hour and suddenly use fingerprint on display it takes slightly more time than usual (approx. 0.8secto 0.6sec.) Later it will work fast and fine.
Service: Its a start up, so authorised one plus service centre are mostly in big cities like Bangalore,Pune , Mumbai, Delhi etc.
Summary:
GO FOR IT, I switched from iPhone 6s to one plus 6t , I don't regret it,and you will also."
130,"I am a OnePlus One user who upgraded to this phone. Considering this fact, I am loving this phone. It's been 4 days since I got OnePlus 6T and I have charged only a couple of times for an hour or so each time; the battery is just brilliant. If you are someone who loves to click pictures and take selfies, you won't be disappointed with the various features of the camera in this phone. I got 6 gigs of ram and 128 storage space in this phone, and it's damn quick and no lags or hangs so far! If you don't like the notch, not to worry, you will be able to disable it.

One major disappointment was the 3.5mm jack's death. However, with their Type-C headphone adapter, you can manage to plug in your 3.5mm headphones.

Lastly, if you are someone who's upgrading from OnePlus 3rd Gen., 5th Gen., or 6, consider waiting for the next phone from OnePlus."
131,"The phone is really good,I bought this phone for gaming and i was satisfied with its performance camera quality is good but not great but i dont care because i am not photographer battery is mind blowing and i love the dash charger display is great easily visible in sun light and the auto brightness works really good the ram management is really great the oxygen os is really a great skin but the in display fingerprint doesnt work well but the face unlock works really good in darkness it uses display as fashlight to unlock"
132,"My earlier OP phone gave up on my a little while ago and I wasn't sure if I should wait for the 6T to launch or just go for another phone. I'm glad I waited. The OP 6T is a beast of a device. The screen is just beautiful and the gestures so smooth. Using the device is just a satisfying experience. The battery life is also incredible. Easily gets me through two days of average usage. The finger print reader is slightly slower compared to other devices with regular scanners, but its not something to be put off by. The only con I have about the device is the single downward facing speaker. It can easily be covered depending on how you hold the phone so not really a great experience while watching something especially in landscape mode. Otherwise, don't think twice about getting this phone. Just go for it."
133,"Lot of issues,
1. Camera gets crashed frequently.
2. Apps crash sometimes.
3. Camera app is dead slow while loading.
4. Picture qlty isn't as expected.
5. Speakers are not good... Voice cracks with half the volume.
6. Gallery crashes sometimes."
134,"Device was working fine till 15days but yesterday all Physical buttons(except alert slider) stopped working suddenly on oneplus 6T.
I have raised the complaint in one plus site but no response yet. don't accept such quality from onePlusm

Other software spects are awesome but if physical hardware is not good then purchasing this device is useless. I have capture video,. Hope I will get response assp."
135,Well one plus 6T is awesome. It's truly a flagship killer. Camera cud have been a bit better but hey it's ok nothing can be too perfect right😂
136,My phone is not having any ringtone.this functionality is not working I have already reported and asked for replacement. Further the set was also not having the pin for sim. It's a terrible experience. Expect immediate action from Amazon and one plus team for replacement of my phone.
137,"There is nothing to say that hasn't already been said. This is the best phone in the market in every department. For this price you can't go wrong with this. I have been a OnePlus user since day one. Spent ages getting an invite for the OnePlus One back in 2014 and ever since I haven't picked any other phone. After the OP One I took the OP 5 and now I bought the 6T. Each and everytime I have been extremely happy with these devices. This one is the top of the category as of now. Works super fast, excellent screen, the notch is minimal. Super fast processor and a brilliant camera. The best thing is the Oxygen OS, butter smooth and has all the features you will ever need and then some more. Go for it with eyes closed.

The delivery was on time. Well packed with tamper proof seal and complete verification to ensure you get the device in pristine condition. They supply a TPU clear case with this device, that was a plus point and a surprise. So out of the box you can slip it into the case and save yourself a heart attack lest you drop it."
138,"Excellent phone
Super fast
Excellent UI
Phone unlock is little slow compared to vivo v11 pro
Camera quality nothing to cheer about. I have a v11 pro and s7 edge. V11 pro clicks better photos in day and night than one plus 6t. S7 edge has better camera than 1plus 6T
Excellent sound quality
Display is above average
Battery backup is good. Charging is superfast.
Alert slider is a new thing.
No expandable storage.
Night mode, reading mode and gaming mode is good.
Battery saver option is quite helpful
Overall an excellent phone. Camera needs improvement."
139,"I was extremely excited about the product and while I prefer ordered through Amazon gift card and bought it on the launch day. I was extremely dissapointed with Amazon. During the sale the offer showed 3/6 month no cost emi and then when I went ahead with 6 months my bank started to charge 13% interest saying we have already given no cost emi discount and now 13% will be applicable. Don't understand the logical behind it, if you are giving a discount why do you find ways to earn it back with false advertisement. Now, the offer has changed and says that's applicable only for 3 months. This really messed up my experience. I have been a one plus user and purchased the same through Amazon on multiple occasion, dissapointed to see the quality and commitment has gone so down so much."
140,"I have been blown away by the performance of this phone.. Everything is smooth and easy. So lets talk about pros and cons:
Pros:
1. Screen quality is great and due to the rain drop notch the real estate has increased drastically.
2. Battery life is the best. You charge it once and even after full day use, its around 30 percent. No need to carry a charger now.
3. With Android pie the apps run smoothly without a hitch and after a month of purchase, its already been updated thrice.
4. Wifi connectivity has increased as compared to earlier models.
5. Due to its aspect ratio, the phone is easy to use by one hand.

Cons:
1. Camera is good but not too great as the features are basic. One plus needs to work on its camera app and give more features to use double lenses effectively. The video has stability issues.
2. The sound quality is better than earleir models but still needs to be louder.
3. The screen protector is a smudge magnet and i would suggest a better screen protector.
4. The sunlight visibility is not too great.

Still after considering all these factors the phone is great and people tend to notice it in your hand.

My verdict:
Worth buying. Go for it. You will surely be excited."
141,"Please note my comment this phone is really very pathetic and if the phone got hanged then you can't do anything , the power key was also won't work. The reason for sharing this review was yesterday I was launching the game app and phone was hanged for a long time and I tried to long press the power key button and took out the SIM but nothing won't work.This is really very disappointment for me and other end user. I have trusted on oneplus instead of Iphone , but the result is opposite. Finally, waste of money and time ,battery backup is also worst, launching the game app phone got hanged. In my point of view nothing is good as per my requirement.I was unable to uplad the video because of size issue."
142,Worst product not even that much worth that it costs waste of money
143,"Oneplus has always been my favourite device.
I owned a oneplus 6 and i was happy back then. The biggest mistake i made was when upgraded to oneplus 6t.
camera is quite similar to oneplus 6
device functions almost as smooth as oneplus 6
BUT BATTERY!!!!!! THE BATTERY IS A BUMMER...
battery drains so quickly. battery lasts longer only when the data is turned off,and i stick to only making/attending calls.
1 hour of usage <whatsapp/facebook> and the battery reduces to 50%
1 single game , and battery reduces by 12-15%

i mean, why would anyone want to pay 38000 for a device thats good only for attending/making calls alone????

rated 3 stars only because oneplus has been my personal favourite of all time"
144,"Yesterday, I bought Oneplus 6T - 8GB RAM - 256 GB Storage, Mobile.

 I ordered for this phone on 02 November 2018 and as assured, Amazon delivered it yesterday. Thanks to Amazon.

I have started using it. So far, so good.

 When I charge this Mobile, the Charging Light is not glowing.

Is there a Charging Light in this Mobile?

OnePlus company says 'No Charging Light' in this mobile.

Thumbs Down not to have this basic feature in this model.

 The printed Quick Start Guide which came with this mobile is in Red Colour Paper with Black Colour tiny font, making it too difficult to read during night even with good tubelight.

 This mobile is available only in two black colour variants. They should at least make it available in White colour also.

 The weight of the Charging plug is more. I feel it may be around 175 grams.

Thanks."
145,"I'm using the device from past month. The interface is smooth. Some one told me that the indisplay finger print scanner is not a good idea and face unlock is not good in this phone but I feel indisplay finger print response is so quick(not fast as physical finger print) face unlock is a flaw because you can see there are separate hardware require for the face unlock so that your phone will be secure. Most of the phones come with face unlock using camera but that's not a good idea. You should have in built hardware to setup your phone in safe and secure like iPhone and recently Huawei mate 20 pro which has in built hardware like dot projection. Ram and memory management are good. Camera is not the best but I feel it's good and the night mode is also good. Gaming mode is ultimate. Battery is good as I turn my internet and stream YouTube and it last for more than a half day. If you are a heavy user you can use 8 hours max. If you are a moderate user then you can use it for a day. If you are normal user then 1 and half day maximum.
I will give my rating for the mobile : 9/10
Camera: 7/10
Ram and memory: 10/10
User interface: 10/10
Battery:9/10

Pros:
Good interface
Battery life
Display
Ram and memory
Notch design

Cons:
No head phones jack
Ip68 water resistant
Face unlock is not secure it need hardware"
146,"I got 8GB * 128GB version. The review it in a word, it's a beast. CNET mentioned it as ""Hero phone without sky high Price"". It's true. At this price range it's a great value for money. OnePlusen launching amazing phone's and this is the latest of the greats. No bloatware at all, nothing pre-installed except few handy OnePlus apps for file transfer and a forum, Definitely enhances the Pure Android OS.

Games are running at ultra or high. Haven't hanged at all with lot of apps running, gaming is smooth and this one has a RAM optimiser for the purpose, its my 1st time with SD 845, best fit into this. Good picture clarity too, nearly 2k.

Camera is great, especially the portrait mode. Selfies are neat. Though the 2nd lens purpose is limited, reading from most reviews.

Amazing UI, appreciation is heartfelt.

The build is brilliant and sleek. Comfortable to put it in pant pockets and can be handled with one hand though I won't necessarily do that 😄. Notch is unobtrusive and looks cool, and hiding option available. Night mode is a good thought. I don't have to download an extra app. (My 1st time with an OnePlus and I'm happy about the handy features it comes with, if some features I'm mentioning is already there leave it).
In-display FP sensor is faster. I don't have compulsion for it to open in 0.0003 seconds like it has been stressed in the YouTube reviews, it's faster than fast-enough.

Battery life is awesome, 3.7k mah. It's like it has a compulsion to stay on. Not at all draining at any point.

Sound quality is great too, though stereo could have been better. It's like I'm hearing everything from right or left side, on landscape mode. Anyways I'm either going to use an external speaker or a headset, so no probs.

Pricing is great, definitely not overpriced. Phone with this specs are being sold at 10k higher prices or of lower quality of experience, by others, and this phone is built with Users in mind, I can confidently say that, it has many handy utilities.

Only problem is something that is not with the phone, actually 2 , a bit overpriced official protective bumper case, and no preferential tempered glass or information about if we need it at all. I got the phone on 2nd November, I still have that out of the box screen cover & case. I couldn't find reliable tempered glass, the Amazon recommended are not fitting the phone screen, and their choice have changed twice in 3 days 😄 . So I've ordered 3 of them 😁 let's see which will fit, I'll return the other 2.

The protective bumper case is 2k, though it's official it can easily be priced 500rs below (don't say, you can buy the 1.2k priced one right? Both are a bit overpriced. You are great at what you do, you don't have to take pricing decisions like other phonemakers, your flagship is an example for that) And also to OnePlus guys, so many fake reviews in this area. You have to intervene, your product's accessories are being spammed by fake-reviewed Tglass sellers. Better you soon release your own tempered glass.

Got the promo code and getting the bullets headphone in a day's time. A small help from a beneficiary. Keep up the good work OnePlus."
147,"After buying 6T for myself, I decided to gift this Superman to my Partner, He was such a loyal fan of another brand that I had to let him know what he was missing. I surprised him with this phone and Rest is history. HAHHAHA..... He fell in love with its speed, that beautiful Purple color and ofcourse he became the newest converted fan of One Plus.
Im in Love with One plus, It is one of the most awesome brand.
PRO--
The color is Fab
Sound is awesome
Speed ... VHROOOOM.... Its super fast
Its Big and beautiful
Ohh! Totally for this price its A STEAL

CON
Well, Ive used 5T and as well as 6T, I say the improvement in Battery is visible.
It stills drains very fast and Dash Charger is great but its irritating to keep on charging.
Other than that ..... Its an awesome Phone... Just Go for it.

P/S-- Please Amazon when we customer use Fast delivery and Pay for it. The work should be done properly. Its high callousness of your side to not deliver on time. Refund can be done but that Lost time and Trust does not come easily. Please do take this Feed back seriously,"
148,"I was considering pixel 3xl, but believe me this is way more better than half a pixel 3xl(may be even better than a full one ..lol). This phone is super practical and is a real companion in your day to day tasks. The gestures are beautiful. RAM is so much that I guess whole OS would fit in making everything just spontaneous. Zero lag in any thing. The draw V to start torch is super handy. Camera might not be like pixel 3xl, but for a person who takes normal amount of photos, it is more than sufficient. You won't be unhappy at all with camera.

It comes with screen protector preapplied. A very good case.

No headphones - not a big deal(u probably will buy your own at some stage)

Fingerprint sensor is like just a little bit under 1 second. But it won't make your life slow at all.

If you can afford it and want an upgrade, buy it, period"
149,"Absolutely top notch phone!!! No need for big reviews with pros and cons. Just know that the pros are almost everything and cons are mostly limited to minor s/w bugs. This Onpelus keeps fixing very fast with OTA updates. Previously my only issue was that of Android OS updates as Oneplus was very slow or never pushed updates. This comes with the latest version of android and hoping for faster updates in the future.
Battery life is legendary... Getting close to 6 hrs of SOT nd that's just phenomenal.
Camera is great, may not compete with the pixel but who wants to anyway. At the price its just great.
Lack of a headphone jack is a definite letdown but keep the in box dongle fixed to your existing earphones or upgrade to some good Bluetooth headsets during sale.
Have not seen any major issues yet and performance is very smooth and super fast.
The animations may feel a bit too buttery for some, in such cases go for changing animation scale in the developer options.
Overall fantastic ... As subject says... Just buy this!!"
150,Amazing battery life and a great experience to use it.
151,"I am ratting the Amazon transportation services, worst ever find again and again, I found no scope of improvement with so many compliments. OnePlus should have to go with flipkart for better customer support and services."
152,"This is my first experience with one plus. Good camera, better performance, good screen quality but phone little bit heavy. Go for it."
153,Did not get a physical bill device is good
154,"OnePlus is the best when it comes to performance in Android. Much better than the pixel phones, which is a shame. I was using OP5 before this for a year and a half before I shattered the screen. So I decided to go for 6t now. To be honest I didn't want to buy a new phone since the old one worked as good as new with no slow downs.
Coming to 6t, this is a powerhouse. Never faced a hiccup in any apps, the camera is above average, but I'm not a photography enthusiast. Gaming performance is epic! And it charges extremely fast thanks to Dash charging.
The only downside to this phone is the slightly slower finger print sensor. You'll notice it if you're coming from older OnePlus devices, which had a lightening fast sensor. But it's nothing you can't get used to.
The notch is one of the most subtle ones on the market.
I would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a new Android device."
155,Horrible thing happened to my phone: my screen blacked out and phone suddenly stopped working just after 15 days I bought it. I took it to the service center and they said it's some technical error and they erased all the data... I lost all my contacts and pictures and unfortunately I did not have back up. Wors experience ever. . I did not expect this from a good brand like one place. I'm so unhappy with this. I lost my valuable data. Never had such experience with any of the phone I used till now.... I also read reviews on Google and not only me but many customers have faced this same issue..so so disappointed
156,This is really nice product. There are certain drawback like no led notification and no always on display despite having smiled screen. But overall it is very nice and fluid to use. Camera are same as earlier. Night scape mode may not be the best but it still way better than anything else in this price bracket. Mirror black finish also hides the fingerprints to some extent which is also good. Performance and fluid Ness is something which has hooked me for first time for using OnePlus devices. And I must say that it is really fluid and battery life exceptional now with 3700 mah. With moderate usage I am always getting screen on time of anywhere between 6 to 7 hrs so with normal moderate use it will always last you for a day and half. In display fingerprint scanner may not be fastest and always accurate but it is still unique and serve the purpose. Overall a good clean android performance phone to have.
157,i had buyed 6t mobile today and i had puttedlock to it and it had worked for 10 min and after 10 min ph is not opening lock and it is telling incurrect pin and appearing as dummy ph display so plz dont buy this kind of cheap ph friends i had suffered lot and i went to service center to solve my problem they r telling that we dont have this soft ware u directly contact to customer service they wil solve your problem they r telling like that so plz dont buy this kind of stuppid company phones
158,"I purchased the phone on the 1/11/2018. I have purchased one plus 6 on 24/08/18. When I had received my OnePlus 6 and started using it my joy was countless. After years of tradition of using Moto phones I upgraded here. The OnePlus 6 is a seamless ph with many good things. Within months I upgraded to OnePlus 6t. OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6 t are basically the same phone. It's not much worth upgrading. Both has oxygen 9, same camera, even night mode is available here. Comparatively 6 is lighter and can be held better in hands than 6t. Software no difference. Difference is battery n minimum storage, Tear drop notch. Overall the pH cannot be compared with anyone. It's a giant in itself. Smooth touch, good camera, fast touch responses, everything is very nice. It is difficult cto bring the experience in writing. It should be felt. It's worth to use the phone."
159,"So this is my first time writing a review about anything , normally i read and watch reviews given by other people but this phone is getting a lot of criticism .
The reason might be the design the not change in hardware and other things.But people don't realize that this phone was not made for the people who owned the one plus 6 ,it was for the people who were upgrading form a one plus 3 or 3t or 5 .
Me being a user of one plus 3t absolutely love one plus foe their software and hardware
when they had launched the one plus 3t it was not a major upgrade over the 3 but a phone for the people who were looking to move into the one plus ecosystem ,it had the same design and almost the same specs (sanpdragon 821).
Now coming back to the main topic the review
the design is a minor upgrade over the last model
as the notch is smaller and there is no headphone jack (the hardest of choices require the strongest of wills)
i don't mind the removal of headphone jack as i really wanted to buy the one plus wireless bullets but they are still not available and I had to buy the type c bullets instead of them.
The hardware is good but could have been better i.e in the camera they could have given a secondary wide angel lense .
the haptic feedback could be better .
Now the software we all now that oxygen os is one of the greatest crearion of one plus as it is optimized and snappy at the same time but there the are few things that i would like inculded in the software like manual video mode and a refresh ti the text message app.
Now there are some things that i love to the use of Android pi , the inscereen finegeprint , night mode .
There are also a few tiny deatils lik if you chek incoming vibration pattern they have new names for every pattern .

This one plus always holds a special place in my heart and i absolutely love this phone and i would recommend this if you're looking for an update
( but not an update over the 6 )"
160,"Pros:
Processor (at par with the best smartphones available currently, great for high end gaming and multi tasking)
Display (great resolution)
Looks (very premium)
Battery Life (excellent fast charging, an hour's PUBG play sees a battery loss of merely 15%)
Sound quality (Single firing speaker does the job well)
In-display fingerprint scanner (after the 1st update it works perfectly well each time and it's lightning fast and the animation is a stunner)
Face-recognition unlock (Best is class, works in milliseconds even in low lighting conditions)
Cons:
Camera is a disappointment (there are lower value phones whose cameras are much better, nightscape mode is okay if you have very stable hands, use a stand)
Mirror back is a finger print magnet (impossible to use without a case)
Omission of the 3.5mm headphone jack (using the dongle is an embarrassment)
8GB RAM variants are extremely overpriced (Race with Apple will cause OnePlus to lose)"
161,"Being a tech savvy person, I have owned a Galaxy S3, iPhone 6 and was using a Galaxy S8 until I replaced it with a OnePlus 6T. It was my first experience of trying a smartphone out of my comfort zone (a samsung or an apple).

OnePlus 6T has met all my standards
• Premium phone (both look and feel) at the best price
• Screen resolution is good
• The battery life is amazing. To be exact, I watched Brooklyn 99 for an entire day (10 hours) on the Netflix app
• The processing speed is mind blowing. 0 lag
• Camera both front and rear are super amazing with potrait modes. Night feature for night photography takes time to process but I'll say the picture is worth the wait

Nothing can be perfect, some negatives
• On screen fingerprint takes time to open and struggles to work with dirt on the screen or a fat tempered glass
• Night feature takes a lot of time to process the photo
• No health app to monitor the steps. In-built pedometer is something I look for in a smartphone
• Phone is heavy but battery life compensates the struggle

I am really happy with the phone and would suggest most of you to buy it. It'll be foolish right now (November, 2018) and spend that kind of money to buy an apple, a samsung or a pixel unless you are a die hard fan of those smartphone. I respect your opinion."
162, This is Awesome phone i have ever used the speed is super blazing the sound & camera quality is Best from other Competitive Smart phones the Papaya orange bezzel at back is so Satisfying carbon fiber cover in it and the new Innovative Warp Charge is Thunder Fast in 5 min It charge 12% Speed and Everything on phone camera Front + back are Extra Fine then expection.
163,"It is a very amazing device just i would say , it's not a very big upgrade from last device bt still it's very good , the best in market , 1 star has been reduced just because of headphone jack as everyone wants a headphone jack , maximum people i mean. Quality of the product is good , battery life is also good and charging speed is best in class . Camera is also very good and competes against the best of other flagships. Just go for it in this price range , no other phone can be better. 4 stars because there is always a space of improvement and no device is perfect."
164,"If this is what OnePlus are going to offer then I am sold. I think the phone looks absolutely stunning and yet not flashy, it's understated good looks gives it that upmarket feeling. You don't get a flagship device at this rate. I don't change phones frequently so this phone will be with me for atleast 3 years and as it is my first OP device so I will keep it with me. So next Oneplus will be 9 or 10 God willing. But I tested the bullet headphones and they are good but can be much improved. If possible do bring back the headphone jack and led notification. Great Job OP and Amazon.
One person found this helpful"
165,"OnePlus 6T is my first OnePlus device and I'm in love with this phone, 6T is the fastest flagship phone I have used till date I'm saying this dispute being a Apple Sheep for some time. OP6T has good battery life, Powerful processor for fast multitasking, amazing Graphic Processing power that can chew through graphic intense Games like PUBG-M,Fortnite and Asphalt 9 with ease, The Phone has good RAM management, decently loud speakers, Dash Charging works as advertised, OLED Display is decent with accurate colour reproduction, Tear Drop Notch is non-intrusive during Gaming and watching Movies (Though you have options to completly hide it), Thin side Bezel smaller chin add a very immersive experience during enjoying videos streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, APV, Twitch, etc.. dispite the lower availability of content that would take advantage of the phones aspect ratio.
The phone dose comes with few Bloatwares which can be uninstalled, Oxygen OS is simple to use & as close to stock Android OS.
Call Quality, cellular connectivity, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth are excellent.
In-display Fingerprint scanner ""Just works"" with blazing fast Facial unlock.
Camera is perfect in segment with ability to shoot decent photographs and 4K videos @60FPS.
The Phone is well built/designed with Glossy Glass Body that gives it a premium feel and look.
Amazon Delivery was fast dispite my remote location."
166,"First of all I would like to share the seller feedback, the delivery was awful by Amazon.

But it was overruled by Oneplus, means oh my god, what a phone, awesome phone , nicely packed.

Display 5 *
Camera 5 *
Battery 5 *
Value 5 *
Interface 5 *
Overall 5 *

Most important part is migration of data from old to new, thanks to oneplus switch app, oh it's too cool.

My overall experience with first Oneplus is seems so good.

Need some improvement , for e.g. music player and video player is missing.

Let me use for few more months and then again revised or repost the review."
167,"Performance : Give anything to it, it will work like a charm.
Camera : May be no much technical upgrade from 6, but this is better than 6. Pro mode of one Plus is pretty awesome.
Battery: Getting one day + battery life (pubg , YouTube, pinterest, music ,watsappil and calls).
On screen Finger print scanning : After the first update the speed of finger print recognition drastically improved. No issue in speed and reliability. Cool and handy feature.
Charging : 1hr 15 mins to 10-100 percentage (my personal experience)
Call quality : No issue, loud and clear.
Speaker: Loud and clear.
Face recognition: Very Very fast but will not work in dark condition.
In-hand feel : Quite light and handy.
Software : Oxygen OS you will love this, sure."
168,"I'm writing this after a complete one day use. First of all mobile looks very premium in hands. AMOLED display with notch is quite awesome. Sound output quality and call quality is good. Battery life for minimal users will be 1 and Half to 2 days. For users who browse and play games will be one day. 0-70% quick charge will happen in first 30-35 minutes and overall it takes 55mins to an hour time for full battery. An immediate security patch for better enhancements will be available. Camera quality is good pictures are coming out like awesome in all the modes. Upgraded from OnePlus 3 after two years of usage to 6t. Bought mobile for 25744 after exchange and other discounts. Phone is good at speed. Ram optimization is nice. Total available space will get is 113 GB out 128GB. You have OTG support. The Oxygen OS is terrific with customization. Will be having a default applied screen protector and also back case which is good available in box. One thing which I have noticed is the download speed from Jio SIM is bit slow for first 3 to 5 hours. After that don't know it picked up really well. Go for this phone when you need all the features at a minimum cost with premium feel.

Will let you know more after usage."
169,"Loved it, I bought OnePlus Six 3 months ago, I Just now purchased the New One Plus 6t and At this price this Phone is par from even any phone in India , I have used Y1 Y2 Note 5 Pro and Even Mi 3s pri e but Now comparison at all, You Will get the worth of your money."
170,"Let's not waste time.

Using it from 2nd Nov. 256GB Model

Sound is not noteworthy just like any other 10k-15k phones. Dual speaker slot is just for show. There is only one speaker the other one is mic. Just confirmed from OnePlus team.

Picture is just good. Reading mode is really useful for bookworms. Much like kindle readability.

Battery is no doubt awesome and so is the charging time. First time when I charged the phone, it took 1 hr 15 mins from 20% to 100%. Next time it took 40 mins.

More reviews coming up soon."
171,"It's simply a burdenless phone.Very user friendly and the oxygen os user interface is ineffably smooth.
Nice touch of elegance and strength.
Touch delay is almost zero and in performance it's a real life hero.Beauty performance and simplicity are the distinct features of this dark knight.
Fast and furious android experience mesmerized me and now it is an inseperable limb of my digital life!
I love it because I have no other choice.
Hope one plus make it more featuristic and usable because it's not only their business but also their social responsibility as this is the only brand which thinks not only to maximise the profit of the organisation but also the utility of the loyal and precious customers of them them.
Thank you Amazon for this wonderful product as their business partner and thanks to One Plus for their deep emotional involvement in the one plus community and yielding their positive response always in favour the consumers."
172,"So many reviews are already available.. not sure my review is going to make any difference.. still.. :)

The best feature is definitely the great battery life and dash charge. I have gifted this phone to my better half and she is very happy with this feature. Her earlier phone was tested and trusted companion for four years - OnePlus One.
I am using OnePlus 5 for last one and half years. So it is very clear that we are fanboys-girls of this great products.

The photography quality is pretty good and the pro mode can be very interesting to use; if you have the time to tinker with it.
The sound quality is also very good; though i prefer to hook it up to the bluetooth speakers we have at home.
Above all the basic phone functions like the reception/ data/ call quality are perfect. The screen quality is awesome (much better than my OP5).
Overall a perfect phone under 35K.
I bought it under exchange scheme against old OnePlus phone and extra card discount. it made a pretty decent deal. INR 33,349 plus another 1500 cash back on card..."
173,"Product, zero out of 10
Don't buy 6T
For all oneplus user don't move from oneplus 5 or 5T to 6T"
174,"Migrated from Oneplus 2 to Oneplus 6T and I am happy with the upgrade. After purchasing my first Oneplus 2 3 years before, I became a fan of Oneplus as I never had any issues. Oneplus 6T is having smooth navigation, hell lot of features dont know whether everyone uses all the features or not. Pics taken from the camera are awesome. Battery life is good, super fast charging. Phone size is also good while holding the phone with one hand. Only drawback that I have seen is removal of 3.5mm audio jack, so I have ordered one from oneplus site for 1.5K. Overall its an awesome phone. Thanks for Amazon for a quick delivery."
175,"The One Plus McLaren edition is amazing no doubt about that the only issue I have is the warranty card and pin ejector are missing from the package box. I didn't shoot the unboxing video assuming there won't be any problem.
So the only concern of mine is whether the warranty card will be provided or not; if not then at the service center what document should I provide for any services that I would be needing during the warranty period."
176,"My sister is not a tech savvy person. She didn't want to spend a lot of money. Her iPhone broke twice. So she was sick and tired, asked me for a suggestion and we purchased this for her. Right off the bat, the setup process was easier than expected. All her contacts came through immediately, she found the phone big but not so big that she could not handle it. She was initially worried about using such a big phone but now almost 2 months later, she never even talks about her iPhone. She is a person who works daily and has to report her location to her bosses sometimes working late till 1-2AM and this phone works perfect for her. The screen though it is not as gorgeous as a Samsung s9, it has its own advantages. The customisation, battery life, the fact that this comes with a case, the ease of use have all won my sister over and maybe she will never go back to iOS. For this reason, I want to give the phone a perfect 5 stars. I personally use a s9 plus but if I had to go to a different phone, it would be either the Mate 20 Pro or this. Why not? Did I say it is delightful that this ships with inbuilt 128GB? AMAZING."
177,"Everything is good about the phone but the in-display fingerprint sensor is substantially not accurate and consistent. OnePlus should have gone with the physical fingerprint reader and should have waited for the new Qualcomm 3rd gen in-display fingerprint sensor.
OnePlus actually made its phone slower with this in-display technology by implementing it too soon.

Camera is great as it is always been but the night mode shots are with the night mode is not good at all and infact the normal camera mode in the night will give you better shots as compared to the night mode."
178,"Got the phone last week. Buying this post using One plus 2, 3t, 5t and finally bought this. Was so much excited but ended up feeling cheated. The play store stops downloading apps after sometime, though the internet just works awesome and downloads any size file at the same time from chrome. Got the device replcaed as google & one plus said it might be device issue. But even the NEW DEVICE does not work properly and play store stops downloading apps after sometime. This is very frustrating. Never expected this from one plus.

Placed request to return it now. Won't suggest anyone to buy it. Go for something else."
179,"Great device. Amazing speed. 8gb ram and superior processor work at lightning fast speed. I play a lot of online games and with this device I can open multiple games without worrying about device slowing down. On my previous phones, the games always caused issues like heating of device, device becoming abnormally slow and rapid battery discharge. This device solved all my issues. I have used fast charging devices as well but the speed of charging of this device is the best among any I have come across till date."
180,"Oneplus 6T is the best phone you can get with less than half the price of iPhones.
All the features are really good. Oneplus has been consistent in upgrading their brand & added new features into their phones. I am skipping the PROs of the phone(which is a huge list, already described by many ppl)
CONs:
Fingerprint sensor - slower than previous models + you need the screen to be switched on before using the fingerprint
Headphone jack removed & extension chord is provided. This is a big let down!
Tq"
181,"What a phone! I have been using it since the past few weeks. Here's my experience:

Pros:
- Battery life for over 16-18 hrs on an average with screen time of 4-5 hrs plus. This is the best I have seen so far, more so impressive with a screen size of 6.4"". So you won't need to charge it during the day mostly. Also, notice a near linear drain until the last juice.
- Speed is fantastic. Not seen a single clipping or lag so far. I need to catch on my speed infact ! Games like ashphalt play completely lag free! What more do you want and at this price point ! Hence no need of frequent restarts ! ,😅👍
- On screen finger print : Quite unlike many critics, I do not see any issues here. It does take a while to get used to it. Acceptable speed for login/unlock. Its one cool feature to show off,😀
- Dual 4G feature on the 6T is a true icing on the top especially for those who use Jio 4G LTE SIM used as a secondary data.
- Display is good with standard 1080 resolution, but not the best. There are better out there in the market. More so, with the bundled screen guard, images and videos do not exactly standout like the Samsung's Super AMOLED displays, which I have used before. I my take off the screen guard one day and check out but for now it remains put on the brand new phone!
- Camera - Sharp and well above avergae photos with the primary camera. Videos are good but the audio capture is outstanding. Nightscapebis very effective. And then there is the pro(manual mode) which is completely customisable, left to your skill with the lens. I have still to get a handle on that one and hence cannot comment as yet. Secondary camera is also nice. Only, I have some trouble taking selfies with the slim form factor, and get a feel that I am missing out on the larger frame. I may be mistaken here though.

Cons
Just a few :
- No ""One hand operation""
- You miss the headphone socket. OnePlus store sells decent headphone (bullet) with USB C plug. You will need one unless you are happy carrying the discerning coverter.
- Status icon list is limited to a few. Not sure why? Is it due to teardrop notch? You need to mostly go an additional touch to pull down and view the usual list of icons typically on the status bar. I find it slightly inconvenient and irritating.
Nothing more to crib about!

Overall a great phone from OnePlus!"
182,"I've always been a OnePlus fan since the days of OnePlus One. I progressed to OnePlus 3, 3T and am now on 6T. Never been disappointed with the hardware and the software. It's blazing fast, nimble, ok with poking around the innards and simply DDG in appearance.

My sons with their Samsung Note 8 and Galaxy 9 are insanely jealous of my 6T. I don't have to say anything more. 😀"
183,"This is my first experience with one plus .
One plus 6t is pretty impressive. Gud battery backup , finger print scanner is real quick , display is amazing , camera is mind blowing,......... Now waiting for the bullet earphones ."
184,"I purchased a 6GB, 128GB phone. I m using the dual camera lens for the first time and noticed some objects getting out of focus in the auto mode. Sound quality is same as before with very little improvement. However, OLED display is certainly good with natural colors. The phone came with pre attached screen guard which absorbs lot of prints requiring frequent cleaning. In screen fingerprint sensor works well. Face recognition is snappy. One plus phones are fast and don't lag like Samsung/Iphone even after 2 years of use."
185,"The display is bright and has got some really good colors. Sound quality is decently loud(just be careful not to cover up your speaker). Since I got my hands on my phone day before yesterday, I haven't given it a rest. After a day's use with reasonable screen brightness(about 75%) and screen on time just above 5 hours, I ended up with 50% juice left. And the warp charging speed is just as promised. I was surprised to see that the battery drained only up to 3% over night. Nightscape in the stock camera is not as good as that in the pixel 3. But I downloaded the pixel 3 gcam mod and it's working just fine."
186,"So I’ve had the OnePlus 6T for a good month now and I think it’s time for a review of the device.

Some background – I wouldn’t call myself a fanboy but I’ve owned all OP phones except for the 3 series. I find their performance to budget ration incredible and while they’ve had problems till OP2 with mediocre hardware, OP5 was the best android experience I’ve had in quite a bit. Then they followed up with the 6 which stuttered a bit out of the box, but they’ve managed to iron out the kinks and now is definitely close to the Pixel when it comes to usability. No hyperbole.

Anyway, coming to this phone, it is definitely one of the best android phones out in the market at this time. The 6 was a good step forward, but I wanted to wait for the 6T and so got this instead. Pretty much everyone here has talked about the specs and the water drop front camera, so I’ll talk about quality of life with this device for over the period.

The exterior has never been exposed to the elements owing to the silicone cover that came bundled with the phone. It is a gorgeous looking device with typical OP design hints. People have always asked me what OP device it is – meaning OP has already established itself as one of the better looking manufacturers of mobile phones.

The camera is fantastic. I have attached a few images but you can’t make out the difference when the resolutions is scaled down. If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say this is still a few notches below the big players, Pixel and iPhone X. But it’s good enough to blow almost any other phone out of the water.

One Plus is a fantastic brand and I urge you to give it a shot – for me, it has been one of the best Android experiences ever."
187,"I have used iphones and latest was pixel 2XL. Was very sceptical about buying this one plus 6t thinking it might be just a Chinese phone.
But to my surprise I was wondering how actually we are being cheated by Google and Apple for such high pricing for their flagships.
This phone is just having all the right things at such a affordable price.
Pros:
Dual sim
Volte and good WiFi and network reception
Battery lasts for one and half days - good
Display is having good screen to body ratio
Camera is better and not awesome when compared to google Pixel
No heating up or hanging issues
Slim and handy
Cons:
Display is not having that much clarity when compared to Samsung or other flagships

Conclusion:
Yup. This is a phone made with so much sense and thinking. Don't waste money in spending for brands. Go for this phone. It is a package with all features with good pricing and will never disappoint you. Thanks for reading."
188,Worst camera quality gives colour issues
189,"I think der is no pretty much change in upgrading from OnePlus 6to 6T,but d product is gud if u get used to it.The Indisplay fingerprint sensor is lagging in terms of speed.pictures r good but capturing of image is slow so u may get blurred or shaky images..battery life is good..n sound system is better..hope OnePlus solves d issues in next updates"
190,"Oneplus always rocks! Been using it since Nov 2, 2018, I just love it! I'm oneplus user since 2015, camera has improved a lot, still cannot match Iphone quality. yet, compared to all other phones(except Iphone), 6T camera is way too good. Audio quality, Performance and battery life are awesome!

Only con I see is this phone is heavy."
191,"That 10 gigs of RAM, holy moly,, ""SALUTE TO SPEED"" and this slogan as per one plus team is accurately correct. Works seamlessly, without any trouble. 256 gigs of storage, thats a lot for most people. Camera fine, sound is good compared to other single speaker phone. The real deal is the display,, I'm loving it.. 🥰
Will update later after testing this beast for a week.

Edit:-
I think the phone wifi has some software problem, because it does not download things on playstore or even update certain applications during 1st attempt ( turning it off and on again & again ). I think it can be fixed with a software update.

Rest All:--

No more complaint. This is beast and works flawlessly."
192,"Purchased the Midnight Black with 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage. A premium smart phone which is sleek, fast and good looking. Have been using the system for nearly a week and am very impressed with the performance of the phone. Battery charge is holding for a good 2 days and thanks to super fast charging, it gets charged soon. Have been watching videos and playing games like Asphalt 9, Need for speed, Fifa. The Graphics and performance is very good. Sound quality is good. Haven't noticed any heating issues so far.
Impressed by the on screen fingerprint scanner. Face detection is also awesome. Haven't noticed any lag.
Call quality is very good.
Overall a very good, solid built phone"
193,"There are many reviews from users as well as reviewers out there. Just my 2 cents:
Pros:
Incredible Battery life with the fastest charging system on the market.
Screen is vibrant and has various colour modes to suit your preference.
Performs like a champ with gaming loads such as Pubg and Asphalt.
Slim and light though mandatorily needs a case as most of the construction is glass .
Camera is a hit and miss sometimes, highly recommend the Pixel 3 camera app port. When it works well, the pictures are fantastic.

Cons:
Some minor bugs such as the accelerometer requires a shake sometimes to get orientation.
The bokeh mode is a hit and miss with recognizing faces and objects.
Build quality is top notch (Heh!) but fragile.
If you're used to a 3.5mm jack, you will most certainly miss the jack.
Never cared about wireless charging so that didn't really matter to me.
Mono speaker."
194,"Does not use global standard power pin. It is big. U need to carry it, means uou cannot use others in case you forgot.

Head set jack and space is not available. Mean you have tk use the oneplus specific adaptor if you want to use.

Power charging is not that fast. It took me 3 hours to charged and already half is gone within 3 hours.

Some of the app was not working

It is diagonally 6.4. but actually some where near to 5.5 horizonal.

Yhe finger print reader is overlapping the keyboard. Many time finger print does not recognise.

Do not recommend. Lost my huge money"
195,"Pros: Works as described, battery is much improved over a OnePlus 3T which is what this phone has replaced. Much smoother to operate too.

Cons: The display is not great compared to other mobiles that are in similar price range or slightly more expensive.

Other thoughts: Not a worthwhile upgrade from a OnePlus 5T which is also what i own"
196,"Best thing about this phone is the software..it's better optimized than pixel 3.you can install Google cam if u want Google nightmode.. great performance and premium looks in a unbetable price..trust me pocophone doesn't even compare to the fluidity and usability of oxygen OS..been using it for 3monts no problems faced.. great community support is also present and you get regular monthly updates..will highly recommend to buy it..it's oled pannel also supports hdr..and playing pubg on it will make your friends more than jealous..the fast charger is to die for...just one hour of charge last 24 hours with screen on time 7hours plus..and 10hours if it's in battery saver..the hardware is great but the software is where OnePlus is leading..it's oxygen OS is better than stock Android it has global dark mode, inbuilt applocker ,touch ID support, AR support any many more awesome features..my best purchase to date."
197,No earphone and no case cover in this cover so it's absolutely fake products ..it has a big cheating to as…
198,"One Plus 6T is an amazing phone for speed and performance and camera quality. It also has a very good battery backup and can easily go upto 1.5 days at least with day long internet browsing and video streaming and music. If you are a hard core gamer like me, you can definitely count on this phone! Great gaming performance without lag or heating issues and can easily support hours of gaming time without charging. I have been using this for about 15-20 days now and am already a big fan of this One Plus device. This is my 2nd One Plus phone and they have proved it again that this really is a flagship killer!"
199,"Writing this review after using the OnePlus 6T around a month. I boutgh 8GB/256GB, Midnight black Model. Following are the pros and cons, I observed:

Pros:
-Speed is really fast.
-Smooth and user friendly operating system.
-Premium look.
-Excellent screen and colours.
-Best in class camara.
-Full battery charge in 60 mins. In normal usage battery lasts around 30 hours.
-Company provided fast charger.
-Company provided mobile cover which is quite decent. I am using the same cover and it really holds the premium aesthetics of the phone.
-Phone has 8 GB RAM but it does not get heat while charging or on excess use.

Cons:
-I did not like the sound quality at the high volume. It loses voice clarity on full volume.
-Difficult to use without a cover, it's too slippery.
-Slightly on a heavier side phones.
-Auto Brightness does not give good results while watching videos. You have to increase Brightness manually.
-3.5 audio jack not there.
-Phones in peer companies provide front flash as well, which is not in this phone. Though it uses screen light for the same feature but that's not as effective.

Hope you find this review useful. Don't forget to like it :)"
200,"I have been using Samsung Flagships all my life. Switching to OnePlus was a nervous decision but it made all the difference.

OnePlus does everything better. (except Camera - which I hope will get better in future).
Samsung just cannot compete with the performance and endurance of OnePlus.
Although Samsung phones feel more premium in the hand, but everything else in OnePlus far outweighs the lack of supreme build quality.

A good decision for sure!"
